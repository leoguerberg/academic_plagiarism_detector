Academic Plagiarism Detector
========

After introducing myself to the world of NLP for a while, I decided to implement an algorithm that uses Machine Learning for the automatic detection of plagiarism between two documents (PDF or DOCX).

This was developed using the Fast Text model (Deep Learning model).

It includes several concepts of NLP such as:
*   Word embedding.
*   Topic clasification.
*   Named Entity Recognition.
*   Web Scrapping.

After running the algorithm, it exports a CSV with the following information:
*   Original document.
*   Sentence of the original document.
*   Sentece of the document we are checking.
*   Trust interval of the prediction.
